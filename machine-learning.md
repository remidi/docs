+ Ratio of positive to negative class is quite large 
+ Generally used for fraud detection type of problems where there are far more positive case (non fraud) than 
fraudulant cases (negative)
+ Tracking flase negative rate is better than accuracy since it doesn't signify the negative case but also penalizes 
flase positives.
